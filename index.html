<div>

<h3><b>Goal Statement</b></h3>
<p>To participate actively in the community for the children, provide learning packages and learning opportunities to enhance children’s knowledge in our community.</p>

<h3><b>Need</b></h3>
<p>Many children in our community lack proper education, which leads to several short term and long term problems like poverty and unemployment.</p>

<h3><b>Target Audience</b></h3>
<p>Our target audience for this project is the underprivileged children of our city that lack enough opportunities to access adequate education. We would like to provide for them and develop a new system of learning for them.</p>

<h3><b>Global Context</b></h3>
<p>We chose fairness and development as our global context because it highlights how everyone should have equal access to education, and the system should be more fair to the underprivileged people. This is also relevant to the development of future systems, and the development of interpersonal skills that the children develop through education.</p>

<!-- COMMUNICATION -->
<section id="communication" class="alt">
<h2>Communication</h2>

<h3><strong>With NGO</strong></h3>
<p> For our community project, we first had to locate some suitable NGO's and contact them to cater our learning aids to their students. We research a few NGOs and tried to contact them, but to no avail. However, we were able to contact the Maher Ashram. We exchanged several emails with them, and later moved onto phone calls for more effortless communication on both sides.</p>

<h4><strong>Sample Email</strong></h4>
Sample Email
To -- The Head of the Organization Subject: Request to Work With your Organization Respected Sir/Ma’am , We are students of Victorious Kids Educares Class 8. We are working on a project to help underprivileged children get better learning support. We want to understand the problems these children face and find small ways in which we can help, like by using learning and teaching packages. <br>
Our plan is simple and in very easy steps: <br>
<ol>
<li>First, we want to learn about the challenges children face in studying. </li>
<li>We would like to visit a center and talk to teachers or volunteers (if possible).</li>
<li>We want to make simple learning kits, reading cards, small posters, and other useful packages that children can use.</li>
<li>We also want to take small study sessions or storytelling activities, if allowed.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Our goal is to support children for 1 and a half months and make a small but real difference.</br>
<ol>
<li>We kindly request permission to visit your organization and guide us so that we can help in the best possible way.</li>
<li>We promise to follow all rules and instructions given by you.</li>
<li>We will be truly grateful for your support.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Thank You. <br>
Yours sincerely, <br>
Nupur Maini, Suengjae Lee, Viraj Belurkar <br>

<!-- VISITS -->
<section id="visits">
<h2>Visits</h2>

<h3><b>First Visit</b></h3>

<div class="flex">
<img src="visit1.jpg.png">
<p>
We visited the Maher ashram’s Wagholi Office on 7th February 2026, Saturday. We first entered the main building, and had a talk with the head of organization, Ms. Sandhya, whom we had previously contacted. We explained our idea to her, and talked about how we planned to create a system to improve learning for underprivileged children. After the interaction with Ms. Sandhya, we went to a separate place where the children stayed.
</p>
</div>

<div class="flex reverse">
<img src="visit15.jpg.png">
<p>
For the first 10 minutes, we introduced ourselves to them about which school we come from, what our names are and why we came here. They also told us about themselves. We sat in a circle and talked for a while with the children. We saw children from different grades. Most of them were from Grades 2 and 3. However, there were a few younger children in Pre-primary. After introducing ourselves, we asked about their subject preferences, how well they performed in the subjects, and their weaknesses.
</p>
</div>

<div class="flex">
<img src="visit13.jpg.png">
<p>
On our first visit, we provided them with some sample learning aids in order to assess their strengths and weaknesses for basic mathematics. When they were doing the worksheets, we noticed that they were able to do simple addition and subtraction with ease, though they took some time to process the problem. Apart from mathematics, we also assessed that they were good at English.
</p>
</div>

<div class="flex reverse">
<img src="visit16.jpg.png">
<p>
Throughout the visit, they excitedly brought us some of their school library issued story books. Though they were beginner books, the children were able to read them. However, we noticed that the children did not have much interest in reading those books. They also brought us some of their mathematics workbooks, which helped us understand what all topics they covered in their classes. We saw that they cover topics such as time, multiplication, addition and subtraction with two to three digit numbers.
</p>
</div>

<div class="flex">
<img src="visit12.jpg.png">
<p>
This made us realize that we needed to develop more advanced worksheets and bring newer problems so that they could cope up with what they were learning in school. After staying there for some time, we decided that we had gathered enough information for the new learning aids that we would make. We also took into consideration what the director of the center told us about their learning, and how they needed something to help them improve and catch up to their peers in class.
</p>
</div>

<div class="flex reverse">
<img src="visit14.jpg.png" class="extra-large">
<p>
This first visit helped us deeply understand the children’s learning level, their curriculum, and their interest patterns. It gave us the foundation to redesign our worksheets to better match their academic needs and improve their engagement.
</p>
</div>


<h3><b>Second Visit</b></h3>

<div class="flex">
<img src="visit2.jpg.png">
<p>
We went back to Maher Ashram for our second visit on 14th February 2026. This time, we were better prepared to help the children learn, especially in Maths and English. While we took a week’s gap before coming again, we reflected upon what we had identified and learnt about from our first visit. After this, we redesigned our aids and developed a new, more suitable system. What we did was catering our aids to the needs of the Indus students. Since they are more advanced, they require similar kinds of tools in order to make their learning easier. For this reason, we created newer worksheets instead of the simpler, more basic hand-made ones we prepared earlier.
</p>
</div>

<div class="flex reverse">
<img src="visit26.jpg.png">
<p>
The mathematics worksheets consisted of several problems related to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We also included time and word problems. This is one of the sample worksheets that we created for mathematics. For English, we made worksheets related to tenses, punctuation, reading comprehension and some other basic grammar questions. These worksheets helped us make both insights as well as observations about their English performance outside of school.
</p>
</div>

<div class="flex">
<img src="visit22.jpg.png">
<p>
We encouraged the children to attempt the worksheets, from which we further discovered their strengths and weaknesses. From these worksheets, we identified that though the children are good at the subjects, they have limited interest in solving the worksheets or doing their homework. We also observed the worksheets that the students have received from their school. We saw that they are mostly advanced for their grade level, and linked it back to the reason why they required help to cope with their curriculum.
</p>
</div>

<div class="flex reverse">
<img src="visit25.jpg.png">
<p>
Throughout the visit, we helped the children solve the worksheets, and after helping the younger children, we understood that they could read letter by letter, but not full words. In order to further peak their interest, we gave the children some simple gifts that they thoroughly enjoyed. We gave them some soft toys in the form of different animals that were colorful, and for the girls, we also added some cute notebooks for them to solve problems and enjoy with.
</p>
</div>

<div class="flex">
<img src="visit24.jpg.png">
<p>
We also engaged in some group discussions with the children. This helped us interact with them together. However, we were not able to keep them engaged for too long because they kept getting distracted with their toys and caused a lot of chaos. Another challenge that we faced was getting them to solve the worksheets. Whenever we told them to try, they kept talking about their dislike for the subject, and how they were unwilling to do mathematics and English.
</p>
</div>

<div class="flex reverse">
<img src="visit27.jpg.png" class="extra-large">
<p>
Towards the end of the visit, we were finally able to get them to settle down and we made them solve the worksheets. When we left, we recalled what we had done for both these visits, and decided to make more worksheets and make them into a workbook.
</p>
</div>
